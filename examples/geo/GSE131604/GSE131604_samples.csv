Crosslinked Cell lines were quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min at room temperature. After quenching, the material was resuspended in 1% SDS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 10 mM EDTA) and sonicated for 5 minutes with a Covaris E220 instrument, 5% duty cycle, 140 Peak Incident Power, 200 Cycles per burst, in 1ml AFA Fiber milliTUBEs. Soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of H3K27ac antibody, 7 μg of YAP antibody, 1.5 μg of SLUG antibody, or 1.5 μg of TEAD antibody. 5 µg of chromatin was used for H3K27Ac ChIP, and 40 µg for YAP, TEAD4 and SLUG ChIPs. For ATAC-seq, 50000 cells / sample were resuspended in 1 ml of cold ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (RSB; 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 3 mM MgCl2 in water). Cells were centrifuged at max speed for 5 min in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. After centrifugation supernatant was carefully aspirated.  Cell pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin by pipetting up and down three times. This cell lysis reaction was incubated on ice for 3 min. After lysis, 1 ml of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 (without NP40 or digitonin) was added, and the tubes were inverted to mix. Nuclei were then centrifuged for 5 min at max speed in a pre-chilled (4 C) fixed-angle centrifuge. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of transposition mix (Corces et al., 2017)",Genome_build,Supplementary_files_format_and_content,BioSample,SRA,Single cell isolation form tumors,Cell preparation,chip antibody,condition,tissue
