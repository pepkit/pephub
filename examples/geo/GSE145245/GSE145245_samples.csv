Briefly, cells were collected in cold PBS and cell membranes were disrupted in cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). The nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in the transposase reaction mix (25 µL 2× TD buffer, 2.5 µL transposase (Illumina) and 22.5 µL nuclease-free water). Directly following transposition, the sample was purified using DNA clean & concentratorTM-5 (ZYMO research). Following purification, libraries were amplified using 1× NEBnext PCR master mix and 1.25 µM of custom Nextera PCR primers. AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were used to purify the transposed DNA and the amplified PCR products. All libraries were sequenced on a 100-cycle paired-end run on an Illumina NOVAseq instrument.","For ATAC-seq footprinting analysis, all of the read start sites were adjusted to represent the center of the transposon binding event; reads aligning to the forward strand were offset by +4 bp and reads aligning to the reverse strand were offset by -5 bp (Buenrostro et al., 2013). MACS2 (Feng et al., 2011) was used with default parameters to identify all ATAC-seq peaks.
