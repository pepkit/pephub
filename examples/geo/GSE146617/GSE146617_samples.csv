Libraries were sequenced using 75-bp reads on the Illumina platform at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.","Illumina Casava1.7 software used for basecalling., Reads were aligned to hg19 using BWA., For peak calling MACS2 was used.",GPL18573,"Xintao,,Qiu",Xintao_Qiu@dfci.harvad.edu,Dana Faber Cancer Institute,440 brookline ave,Boston,MA,02115,USA,Illumina NextSeq 500,other,genomic,ATAC-seq,GSE146617,0,GSM4399738_ATAC_2480-8_T.bw,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM4399nnn/GSM4399738/suppl/GSM4399738_ATAC_2480-8_T.bw,DF_ATAC_2480-8_T,286398188,BW,localized prostate tissue,ATAC,NA,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN14332948,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term,hg19,bw files were generated using MACS2 using the chilin pipeline
