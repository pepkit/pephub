For the run-on assay, re-suspended nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of reaction buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 300mM KCl, 20 units of Superase.In, 1% sarkosyl, 500µM ATP, GTP, and Br-UTP, 2µM CTP) and incubated for 5 min at 300C. The nuclear-run-on RNA (NRO-RNA) was then extracted with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. After base hydrolysis on ice for 40min and followed by treatment with DNase I and antarctic phosphatase, the Br-UTP labeled NRO-RNA was purified by an anti-BrdU argarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech) in binding buffer (0.5XSSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% tween) for 3hr at 4°C while rotating. Then T4 PNK (NEB) was used to repair the end of NRO-RNA. Subsequently, cDNA synthesis was performed as reported(9,33) with few modifications. The RNA fragments were subjected to poly-A tailing reaction by poly-A polymerase (NEB) for 30 min at 37°C. Reverse transcription was then performed using superscript III (Invitrogen) with oNTI223 primer. The cDNA products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel with right product (~100-500bp) being excised and recovered by gel extraction. After that, the first-strand cDNA was circularized by CircLigase (Epicentre) and re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB). Re-linearized single strand cDNA were separated by TBE gel and the products of desired size was excised (~120-320bp) for gel extraction. Finally, cDNA template was amplified by PCR using the Phusion High-Fidelity enzyme (NEB) with primers oNTI200 and oNTI201 for deep sequencing.","Nascent RNA, Gro-seq in MCF7 cells treated with E2 30min + 2,5-Hexanediol","Basecalls performed using CASAVA version 1.4, Gro-seq reads were aligned to the mm9 genome assembly using Bowtie version 2.0.1.",GPL16791,"Qi,,Ma",q1ma@ucsd.edu,UCSD,"9500 Gilman Dr,",San Diego,92093,USA,Illumina HiSeq 2500,other,transcriptomic,OTHER,"GSE99544, GSE124826",0,GSM3555218_SH-G251_S4_L005_R1_001neg.ucsc.bigWig,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM3555nnn/GSM3555218/suppl/GSM3555218_SH-G251_S4_L005_R1_001neg.ucsc.bigWig,"Groseq-plus E2 (30min) + 2,5-HD",182158738,BIGWIG,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN10715322,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term,MCF7,Human breast cancer cells,,,,,,,bigWig,,GRO-seq,,mm9
