Buffy coats were purchased from Stanford Blood Center and processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using Lymphoprep density gradient medium and SepMate_50 tubes. Isolated T cells were cryopreserved at 2x107 T cells per vial in CryoStor CS10 cryopreservation medium (Stem Cell Technologies).  Cryopreserved T cells were thawed and activated same day with Human T_Expander CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Gibco) at 3:1 beads:cell ratio in T cell media (AIMV supplemented with 5% FBS, 10mM HEPES, 2mM GlutaMAX, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100ug/mL streptomycin (Gibco)). Recombinant human IL_2 (Peprotech) was provided at 100 U/mL.  T cells were transduced with retroviral vector on days 2 and 3 post activation and maintained at 0.5_1 x106 cells per mL in T cell media with IL_2. Non_tissue culture treated 12_well plates were coated overnight at 4C with 1mL Retronectin (Takara) at 25ug/mL in PBS. Plates were washed with PBS and blocked with 2% BSA for 15min. Thawed retroviral supernatant was added at ~1mL per well and centrifuged for 2 hours at 32C at 3200 RPM before the addition of cells.

Samples were split into two replicates each prior to all subsequent steps.  Samples were incubated on ice for 3 minutes, then washed out with 1 mL RSB supplemented with 0.1% Tween_20.  Nuclei were pelleted at 500g for 10 minutes at 4°C., The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 50 μL transposition mix (25 μl 2x TD buffer, 2.5 μl transposase (Illumina), 16.5 μl PBS, 0.5 μl 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl 10% Tween_20, 5 μl H2O) and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes in a thermomixer with 1000 RPM shaking.  The reaction was cleaned up using the Qiagen MinElute PCR Purification Kit.
