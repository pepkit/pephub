Malignants and control Bone Marrow aspirates, were isolated for PCs by magnetic cell separation using human CD138 positive selection kit (Miltenyi-Biotec- Germany) and Macs separator (Macs Miltenyi-biotec- Germany. To perform the analysis 50,000 cells were washed once with 1X PBS and centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes at 4°C. For flash-frozen cell pellets were removed from -80°C and immediately re-suspended in ice-cold cell lysis buffer. Nuclear morphological evaluation was performed by Trypan blue coloration, before starting the tagmentation. Pellets were re-suspended in transposase 25 μl reaction buffer containing 2,5 μl of Tn5 transposase and 12.5 μl of TD buffer (Nextera DNA Sample preparation kit from Illumina) on ice. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The samples were purified with MiniElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen)., To amplify transposed DNA fragments we used NEBNext High-Fidelyty 2x PCR Master Mix (New England Labs) and the Customized Nextera PCR Primers (see Table 3). Libraries were purified using Agencourt Ampure XP (Beckman) magnetic beads (1:1 ratio) to remove remaining adapters and double purified (1:0,5 and 1:1,8-05) for right side selection.
