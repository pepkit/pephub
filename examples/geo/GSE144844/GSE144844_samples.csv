Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 10 min, washed with cold PBS three times and snap frozen. ChIP for SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 was performed by Active Motif Epigenetic Services. Chromatin was isolated with the addition of lysis buffer followed by disruption with a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were sonicated, and DNA was sheared to an average length of 300-500 bp. ChIPs were performed with 30 ug of precleared chromatin and 5uL of anti-SMARCA2 (Abcam, ab15597) or 10uL anti-SMARCA4 antibody (Abcam, ab110641).
