For frozen tissues, ~15,000 nuclei were loaded per capture. Single-cell/nucleus capture, reverse transcription, cell lysis, and library preparation were performed per manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq using apaired-end 100bp protocol.","Single Cell RNA-Seq, Raw data not available due to privacy concerns","For 10x scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq data, we utilized CellRanger (version 3.0.2) for data pre-processing and gene expression quantification, following the guidelines from the CellRanger website., The presence/absence of somatic CNVs was assessed with CONICSmat., The CellRanger ATAC software (version 1.1.0) was used for read alignment, deduplication, and identifying transposase cut sites.",GPL24676,"Aaron,,Diaz",aaron.diaz@ucsf.edu,Diaz Lab,Neurological Surgery,"University of California, San Francisco",1450 3rd St,San Francisco,CA,94158,USA,Illumina NovaSeq 6000,cDNA,transcriptomic,RNA-Seq,BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN15462775,GSE138794,0,GSM4658373_SF11681_matrix.mtx.gz,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM4658nnn/GSM4658373/suppl/GSM4658373_SF11681_matrix.mtx.gz,SF11681,8225758,MTX,,,,Recurrent,,51,Male,hg38,"Matrix file (mtx) includes sparse matrix of read counts, unique cell barcode files (tsv), and feature file (tsv)","GBM, IDH1R132H WT",1) minumum 100 cells present in a  feature; 2) minimum 200 features present in a cell.
