Samples were sequenced PE50 on a HiSeq 2500.","Align to hg19 reference genome using Bowtie 1.0.1, Peak calling to generate signal tracks on on individual replicates using macs2 2.1.1.20160309 with options -B -p 1e-2 --shift -100 --extsize 200",GPL16791,"Hatice,Ulku,Osmanbeyoglu",University of Pittsburgh,5117 Centre Ave,Pittsburgh,PA,15213,USA,Illumina HiSeq 2500,other,genomic,ATAC-seq,"GSE114964, GSE129339",0,GSM3161729_RL95_2_R2.bw,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM3161nnn/GSM3161729/suppl/GSM3161729_RL95_2_R2.bw,RL95_2 ATAC-seq replicate 2,138358039,BW,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN09272127,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term,RL95_2,Endometrial adenosquamous carcinoma,hg19,bw files were generated using deeptools
