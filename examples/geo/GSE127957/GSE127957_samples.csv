Once tumors were palpable, tumor size was measured weekly by tumor measuring system Peira TM900 (Peira bvba, Belgium).","LNCaP/AR cell line was generated and maintained as previously described (Chen et al 2003). Cells were cultured at 37° C (5% CO2) in high-glucose RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% HEPES, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% L-Glutamine. In vivo xenograft experiments were done by subcutaneous injection of 2 × 106 LNCaP/AR cells (100 μl in 50% Matrigel [BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA] and 50% growth media) into the flanks of castrated male SCID mice.",genomic DNA,"Resistant LNCaP/AR xenograft tumors were harvested and the genomic DNA was isolated by two rounds of phenol extraction using PhaseLock tubes (5prime) followed by isopropanol precipitation., All genomic DNAs from tumors, plasmid or pregraft cells were PCR amplified using a protocol previously described (Zuber NBT 2011). Libraries were analyzed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 and 18 nucleotides of the guide strand were sequenced using a custom primer as previously described (Zuber Nature 2011).","Transform files from Fastq to Fasta (galaxy), Clip sequences at TACATC (galaxy), Filter sequences by length (22bp, galaxy), Reverse-complement (galaxy), Collapse sequences to number of reads (galaxy), Align with shRNA guide sequences (use join from Galaxy), Supplementary_files_format_and_content:, Fasta to tabular (galaxy).

However, because in vivo library screening is noisier than in vitro library screening and there are clearly stochastic effects, tumors were collected on week 16 before control tumors arise, resulting in the collection of very different numbers of resistant tumors from each pool. Thus, this data was not directly used as a probabilistic matrix, which would require the same number of repeats an in vitro library.
