Protein concentration in sonicated samples was measured by Bradford assay, and 200µg of total protein was transferred to a 1.5ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf cat# 0030108051) and brought up to 500µl final volume with ChIP buffer. 5µl was removed as input material (1%) and placed in a separate microtube at 4°C. 2µg antibody was used for each histone ChIP (see Key Resources table for list of antibodies). The samples were rotated end-to-end overnight at 4°C. Protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare cat# 17528001) were washed 3x with ChIP buffer and 30µl bead slurry was added to each sample.

Beads were dried after the last wash with a 28G needle fitted to a 1ml syringe. Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M sodium carbonate) was prepared fresh before use and 110µl was added to each sample and 95µl to each input sample that was previously set aside. To elute immunocomplexes from beads, samples were incubated at 65°C for 3hr on an Eppendorf Thermomixer shaking at 1000rpm. Tubes were centrifuged for 3min at 2000rpm at RT and 100µl of supernatant was transferred to a new tube, being careful not to aspirate beads.
