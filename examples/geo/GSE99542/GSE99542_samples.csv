Transposition reaction was performed at 37oC for 30 min using Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina Cat No. 15028212) in 50μl volume (2.5 μl Transposae enzyme, 25 μl 2X TD buffer and 22.5 μl nuclease-free water). The reaction mixture was immediately purified using MinElute PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Cat No. 28006) and eluted in 10 μl nuclease-free water. The tagmented DNA was then PCR amplified using KAPA Real-Time Library Amplification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Cat No. KK2701) in a 50 μl reaction (10 μl tagmented DNA, 2.5 μl25 μM PCR primer 1, 2.5 μl 25 μM barcoded PCR primer 2, 25 μl KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, 10 μl nuclease-free water), using the following program (One cycle at 72oC",cell line,cell type,genotype/variation,treated with
