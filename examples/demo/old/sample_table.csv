Briefly, 5×10^6 nuclei were added to 2 X Nuclear Run-On (NRO) reaction mixture (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM KCl, 1% Sarkosyl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.375 mM each of biotin-11-A/C/G/UTP (Perkin-Elmer), 0.8 u/µl RNase inhibitor) and incubated for 3 min at 30˚C. Nascent RNA was extracted and fragmented by base hydrolysis in 0.2 N NaOH on ice for 10~12 min, and neutralized by adding 1 X volume of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8. Fragmented nascent RNA was purified using streptavidin beads, ligated with reverse 3' RNA adapter (5'p-GAUCGUCGGACUG-UAGAACUCUGAAC-/3'InvdT/), and biotin-labeled products were enriched by another round of streptavidin bead binding and extraction. For 5' end repair, the RNA products were successively treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP, Epicentre) and polynucleotide kinase (PNK, NEB). 5' repaired RNA was ligated to reverse 5' RNA adaptor (5'-CCUUGGCACCCGAGAAUUCCA-3') before being further purified by the third round of streptavidin bead binding and extraction. RNA was reverse transcribed using 25 pmol Illumina RP1 primer (5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA-3'). The product was amplified 15 cycles and products greater than 120 bp (insert > 70 bp) were PAGE purified before being analyzed by Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument.",This Sample represents two sequencing replicates.,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Processed data files are bigWigs.

(Core, Waterfall, and Lis, 2008), with the following modifications. Trizol (Invitrogen) was used to stop the reaction instead of DNase I and proteinase K treatment. The RNA was further extracted once with acid phenol:chloroform, and once with chloroform before precipitating with 2.5 volumes of -20oC ethanol. Bead binding buffers all contained 4units/ml of SUPERaseIN (Ambion) and the following buffers were slightly modified. Bead blocking buffer: 0.25X SSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween, 0.1% PVP, and 1mg/ml ultrapure BSA (Ambion); Binding buffer: 0.25XSSPE, 37.5mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% tween; Low-salt wash buffer: 0.2X SSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween. High-salt wash buffer: 0.25% SSPE, 137.5mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween. The end repair steps were modified as follows. Pelleted RNA from the first bead binding was resuspended in 20ul, and heated to 70oC for 5min, followed by incubation on ice for 2min. 1.5ul tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) buffer, 4.5ul water, 1 ul SUPERaseIn, and 1.5ul TAP (Epicentre) were then added and the reaction incubated at 37oC for 1.5 hours. 1ul 300mM MgCl2 and 1ul T4 polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) were added to the reaction for an additional protocols l 30 min. for phosphorylating the 5'-ends, 20ul T4 PNK buffer, 2ul 100mM ATP, 145ul water, 1ul SUPERaseIn, and an additional 2ul of PNK were added for 30 min at 37oC.
